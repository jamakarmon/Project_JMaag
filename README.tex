Basic information:
This project was written in a MAC OS environment (macOS High Sierra, V10.13.6).
The scripts are written in Python, and the final PDF is compiled with LaTeX. Snakemake is used as a workflow management system.

In the project folder environment:
Execute 'snakemake help' in the shell to get information about the different rules.
Rule 'webscrape' is only executed if called specifically. It scrapes the raw data from Google Trend. This takes a long time, and Google Trends might shut down after too many requests. Thus, it's recommended to split the dates in half (d1 and d2 in 'webscrapeData.py'). Further note, downloading the data again changes the output of the time series analysis.
